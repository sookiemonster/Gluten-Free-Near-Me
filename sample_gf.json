Keep in mind that if a table isn't fully occupied, strangers may be seated together to fill the space.\n\nWhile cocktails are around $20 USD each, they're worth the splurge for their quality. Service is a bit slowly and the place guys busy, epically on weekends. Although the live music experience is vibrant and engaging, making it a must-do activity for visitors looking to immerse themselves in New York's rich music scene.\n\nWhether you're a jazz enthusiast or simply seeking a memorable night out, catching a show at the Blue Note is an experience that encapsulates the essence of the city's vibrant culture. From the electrifying atmosphere to the world-class musicianship, it's an unforgettable journey into the heart of jazz.",

The onions, patty and bun blended so well. I’d like a little more attention to detail on the bun (either fresher, toasted or  coated in some interesting flavour) it was just quite plain. That would be fine if it t was leaving space for the flavour of the patty or onions but it wasn’t the case. The seasoning of the patty could have been better to really get that 10/10.\n🥩 The 8.5/10 Bone in New York Strip was another strong hit. The fat could have been rendered better and there could have been more flavour from the flame but the cooking of the strip was very good. The best part was the peppercorn coating.

I, of course, ordered the black label burger and was pretty disappointed. I thought it lacked flavor, especially to warrant an almost $40 price tag. In fact, I ended up adding a bit of the flakey salt from the bread service to help bring out some taste. The portion size was generous - see the mountain of fries below. I’m glad I tried this dish to say I have, but I would not order it again.\nOverall, the place was nice, and the service was great. But with so many places to try in NYC, I wouldn’t come back.",

To my surprise, I didn't really taste the strong carrot flavor but the taste of the crispy bread with mayo instead! Delicious ❤️\u200d🔥\n\nThe service was amazing too.

To my surprise, I didn't really taste the strong carrot flavor but the taste of the crispy bread with mayo instead! Delicious ❤️\u200d🔥\n\nThe service was amazing too. We asked if the waitress could help charge my friends' phone, and she didn't hesitate to say yes.\nHope I can go back and try other stuff soon. :)",

Not much to the pastas. $119. I thought that looked awfully high, but now in retrospect, after reading other reviews about them adding 18% on top of our bill without advising, then when pulling out our credit card advising that it’s cash only. Then asking us for venmo or something else. We said we don’t have that as we are not American. We are a middle aged couple, not a party. Selfish crooks. I feel completely taken advantage of. Luckily, we were able to somehow transfer money to withdraw in their basement ATM. Hey Canadians, that’s about $7 CAD convenience fee, plus your exchange. Oh and I left a decent tip on top of their flicking stolen tip. Surely with the 18% they added to my bill they could afford to pay the credit card surcharges. Take your business elsewhere.

You can tell there’s been some love and care put into perfecting their food. More importantly, very affordable for all to enjoy.\n\nCan’t wait to come back again on our next visit to the big apple.",

Would recommend and will come back.\nWith my wife we went for a Saturday dinner with reservation. We arrive 20 minutes earlier and we were able to be sited early at the counter. This is another restaurant we saw recommended at the Michelin guide.\n\nFood was incredible: we tried the “small” sushi menu (at $49/person) which consisted on a Salmon tataki, 9 pieces of sushi and 2 sushi rolls. At the beginning I thought we were going to finish hungry give the word “small” on the menu but it was more than ok (and I eat a lot!).\n\nSalmon tataki was good but not great, but you could tell how fresh the fish was. Loved that it was slightly grilled on the top.\nI loved the sushi selection: 9 different pieces of salmon, tuna, yellowfish, among other fishes combined with different sauces which harmoniously enhanced the flavor. The best sushi I had.\nSushi rolls were also amazing (perhaps the highlight of the menu). I had the oyster mushroom roll and the spicy tuna one. Both were very crispy on the outside with an amazing combination of flavors, however the one that my wife order (unagui) was the absolute best.\n\nAt the end we order the matcha pudding which was actually pretty good. Not too bitter and not to sweet – very well balanced.\nService was fast (perhaps way too fast) and attentive.\n\nAtmosphere was very Japanese inspired of course. What was a bit of a disappointment was that we sited at the counter, and we expected that the cooking was going to be happening there but there was only one guy cutting the fishes.",

In total we waited nearly an hour and a half and while the food and drinks were tasty, I’m not sure I would wait that long again.\n\nWe were seated inside and, despite it being pretty cold outside, wished we were seated in the outdoor seating area. The inside is quite cozy and loud since the drinks station is dead center, so you have to tune out the clanging and crashing of cups and plates. The outside area was much quieter despite being near the street and cars.\n\nWe ordered the banter bowl with grilled chicken, and the green vitality and fresh start juices.\n\nThe banter bowl tasted very fresh and light while still being very filling. The miso ponzu dressing tied all the fresh ingredients together and definitely made the fish. The chicken was slightly rough and dry.\n\nThe green vitality was my favorite juice and tasted very green, with particular notes of celery. The fresh start was quite tart and had a nice hint of ginger, but wasn’t for me.\n\nOverall I left Banter feeling satisfied, refreshed, and full enough to continue my day in the city.",

We went on the recommendation of an actual Italian who said this place is one of the few to nail the real flavors of Italy, showing up without a reservation, and even though they were packed the owner or manager sat us right away by a cozy fireplace.\n\nWe started with a pizza with prosciutto that was absurdly good. The crust was perfect and the sauce had a fantastic pure tomato flavor. The Italian who recommended us was spot on. We then had Lasagna - mine the arrabbiata, which was legitimately spicy, and my wife the pesto, which was delicious.\n\nOur waitress was excellent and attentive and the owner or manager came over to check on us as well. Perhaps most impressive is that we got a pizza and two entrees and it was only $70.",

It perfectly complements the menu, which is a celebration of Italian flavors brought to life with skill and passion.\n\nOur culinary journey began with the flatbread accompanied by pesto, a simple dish that was elevated to extraordinary through the freshness and strength of its flavors. Then we had the fried rice ball which was also a stand out.  The chicken ravioli, served with a brown butter sauce, was another standout, offering a beautiful balance of textures and a richness that was satisfying without being overwhelming.\n\nDessert was the crowning glory of the meal - an olive oil cake that deserves every bit of its 5/5 rating. Its moist texture, nuanced flavor, and the perfect hint of olive oil made it an unforgettable end to an exceptional dining experience.\n\nRoscioli is more than just a restaurant; it’s a destination for those in search of genuine Italian cuisine in NYC. Highly recommended for its atmospheric charm, outstanding food, and extensive wine list, Roscioli is a must-visit for anyone looking to indulge in the true essence of Italy.",

They also were overly expensive for how much you get and their quality.\n\nThe atmosphere was fun but cramped, dark, and not the most comfortable.

While it included all the classic ingredients - egg, ham, cheese, and breakfast potatoes - it lacked any real flavor. It desperately needed seasoning, and I found myself relying heavily on the salt and pepper shakers to bring some life to the dish.\nDrinks:\n\nCoffee: Thankfully, the coffee was good and provided a welcome pick-me-up.\nOverall:\n\nJane's breakfast had its ups and downs.
