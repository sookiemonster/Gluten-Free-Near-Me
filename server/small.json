After she saw I didn’t drink my drink she asked if I wanted to swap and I did! It didn’t like it at all. I got the color and co. Which looked gorgeous. But didn’t taste sweet and fruity like the description said. Maybe it was the egg whites I didn’t like but I thought the drink tasted like plastic. She made me a paper plane with no complaints and that was good.\n\nThe happy hour deals are pretty good, for $20 you can get two share plates or an entree and a share plate. The food was just okay though. The chicken sandwhich was pretty spicy and was covered in coleslaw or something. I liked the big pickle with it though. The chicken wings were too spicy too and kind of dry. The salad I had should have been bigger.\n\nIf you are in the area I recommend to try another place for food.",

I find the food to be incredibly expensive for the quality. While you get a decent portion size for appetizers and mains the desserts are tiny and all cost $17 or more.
