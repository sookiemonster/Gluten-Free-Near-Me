After she saw I didn’t drink my drink she asked if I wanted to swap and I did! It didn’t like it at all. I got the color and co. Which looked gorgeous. But didn’t taste sweet and fruity like the description said. Maybe it was the egg whites I didn’t like but I thought the drink tasted like plastic. She made me a paper plane with no complaints and that was good.\n\nThe happy hour deals are pretty good, for $20 you can get two share plates or an entree and a share plate. The food was just okay though. The chicken sandwhich was pretty spicy and was covered in coleslaw or something. I liked the big pickle with it though. The chicken wings were too spicy too and kind of dry. The salad I had should have been bigger.\n\nIf you are in the area I recommend to try another place for food.",

Lacks aromatics and flavor.\n\nPho broth as well was underwhelming. I’m pretty healthy conscious too so I prefer less salty (less sodium) broths. But this one just lacked flavor and was disappointing.\n\nVietnamese iced coffee was good though! But for $7.00 for this is probably pushing the upper range of price points. Food was edible but I wouldn’t come back. Maybe their other dishes are good (vermecelli and other entrees) but the pho and bo kho was meh so I’d expect their other dishes to receive equal treatment\n\nI’d rather spend $$$ at Madame Vo or Sao Mai and get more authentic tasting pho.",

             "text": "I’ve reviewed close to 30+ pho restaurants Growing up around great Vietnamese food. The Bo kho here tastes like beef and carrot water. Lacks aromatics and flavor.\n\nPho broth as well was underwhelming. I’m pretty healthy conscious too so I prefer less salty (less sodium) broths. But this one just lacked flavor and was disappointing.\n\nVietnamese iced coffee was good though! But for $7.00 for this is probably pushing the upper range of price points. Food was edible but I wouldn’t come back. Maybe their other dishes are good (vermecelli and other entrees) but the pho and bo kho was meh so I’d expect their other dishes to receive equal treatment\n\nI’d rather spend $$$ at Madame Vo or Sao Mai and get more authentic tasting pho.",
